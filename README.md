"Numerical integration methods can generally be described as combining evaluations of the integrand to get an approximation to the integral."

Program below uses 5 methods: rectangular, trapezoidal, Simpson's(parabolic) and Gauss–Legendre quadrature with use 2 and 4 number of points. Each of these methods has different accuracy. They're tested on 3 functions defined in Functions.cpp.

Result:
